How to use the PL/0 Code Parser/Code Generator (Linux):

To compile, use the command `gcc main.c -o compile.out`

To run, use the command `./a.out <yourpl0file> [<options>]`

./a.out –l –a –v         Print all types of output to the console
./a.out –v               Print only the VM executiontrace to the console
./a.out                  Print nothing to the console except for “in” and “out”
